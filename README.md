# Advent of Code 2015 solutions (node 14)
- https://adventofcode.com/2015

# To create new day solution, run
  - `yarn generate dayXX`
  - This will create new `dayXX` folder with `templates/default.js` base script and empty text input file
  - Already existing solutions will not be overwritten

# To run specific day solution, use
  - `yarn solution dayXX solutionY [args...]`
    - `dayXX` is the solution folder
    - `solutionY` is the solution number (e.g: `1`, `2`, etc.)
    - `args` are the solution arguments (optional)

# WARNING
  - This is my own personal sandbox. All solutions are work in progress...
  - I tend to revisit my previous solutions as I go along to cleanup my code, but I make no promises ^_^
